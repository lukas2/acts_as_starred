Acts As Starred
===============

Just a simple plugin that allows users to "star" an item, for example a blog-post, as is known from GMail.

To install run:

  rails generate starred
  rake db:migrate

And add the following in your model:
  
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_starred
    ..
  end

This plugin requires that a model "User" exists.
